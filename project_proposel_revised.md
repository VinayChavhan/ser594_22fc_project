5. Description: 
Right now, everything in this world is encompassed by the semiconductors. From electrical little gadgets to huge vehicles, semiconductors are pivotal portion of all these gadgets. There are numerous sorts of semiconductor chips – memory chips, chip, GPUs, ICs, analog chips etc. Although there are numerous semiconductor chips, the base of them lies within the arrangement of the transistors which are fabricated with the assistance of semiconductor wafers made of silicon. These semiconductor wafers are too called silicon wafers and experiences numerous handle operations to deliver the desired plan and arrangement of the transistors. These process operations produce defects unconsciously due to many parameters and surrounding conditions. If the process isn’t corrected, the defective wafers are generated which decreases the productivity of the manufacturing plant. To reduce the defective wafers generation, the wafers need to be scanned at appropriate locations and the images are appropriately assessed to take corrective actions in the corresponding processes. Here in this project, I aim to investigate various image recognition – machine learning techniques to identify the type of defect in the silicon wafer effectively and compare the effectiveness between various machine learning techniques that would be identified.
6. Research Questions:
Research Objectives (RO)
RO 1: To describe the trends withing the semiconductor images on how many defected images are in each type of defect. There are total 9 types of defects.  
RO 2: To predict the type of defect out of 9 defects on the each image and label it.
RO 3: To defend the model for performing the predictions in RO2 we check the accuracy of the model on testing data. I have divided the total dataset into 70-30, 70% for training and 30% for testing.
RO 4: To evaluate the relationship implied by the model prediction and locate the defect on the image.

6. Intellectual Merit: In advance we can locate the defect in the image and mark it. For the basic purpose we just detect whether image contains the defect or not. For new knowledge I can locate the defect in the image and mark it. There is total nice type of defects. I can identify the defect and create new column in dataset to save the same image with defect marking.

7. Data Sourcing: 
There is single source of dataset from Kaggle.
