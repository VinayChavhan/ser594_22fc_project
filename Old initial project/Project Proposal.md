5. Description: 
I plan to build the chatbot where students will come and give the bot academic and entrance exam information and test scores and they will get the university suggestions. The project is mainly based on a suggestion system, the project aims to give suggestions to the students based on their academic merit. After students enter information; the system will take that information and connect it to the university data set and suggest to the students 10 universities' names for which they will have higher chances of getting in. The student may also specify the filter of the universities like region, student-teacher ratio they want, tuition fees, and salary expectations. 

Questions we will about the dataset:
I. What is a source of data and is it valid?
II. Do we have all the required data for our analysis?
III. How big is the dataset?
IV. Is this latest dataset?

Analysis:
a) Access.
There are multiple datasets for this topic. The datasets are available from different points of view like students’ academic performance, American university data, and Graduate school admission data. We need to identify what repositories we need for our analysis.
b) Ingest.
Once the datasets and repositories are identified, we need to combine them and make single universal data for our analysis. 
c) Cleanse.
This is a step where we will deal with missing values, white spaces, out-of-range values, outliers, etc.
d) Format.
In this step, we format the cleansed data from the previous step. We can also identify irrelevant columns from the data and remove them. This will give us clean data containing only the required fields that we want.
e) Combine.
Once the formatted data is ready we can merge it, split it or join the multiple inputs. The output of this step gives us the final data we can use for analysis.
f) Analyze.
Once we start the analysis and want to change something in data or get updated data, this should be performed carefully as small changes may impact the accuracy.

6. Intellectual Merit: 
If the student enters information and it’s excellent, then the next step is to ask for verification. If the student verifies all the academic information, then our app can send mail to the top institute and let them know the potential student they might need to admit, then the university can directly contact the student about the application. For example, Sundar Pichai learned from Stanford with a full tuition-funded scholarship. If the university is looking for the next Sundar, then this chatbot app will be helpful.

7. Data Sourcing: 
There are multiple ways to collect the data like surveys, online monitoring, social media, etc. but since there’s a time limit and we need complete the project this semester itself, I will be using the existing data available on the Kaggle.
